Introduction \u00b6 Starlette API aims to bring a layer on top of Starlette to provide a fast and easy way for building highly performant REST APIs. It is production-ready and provides the following: Generic classes for API resources that provides standard CRUD methods over SQLAlchemy tables. Schema system based on Marshmallow that allows to declare the inputs and outputs of endpoints and provides a reliable way of validate data against those schemas. Dependency Injection that ease the process of managing parameters needed in endpoints. Starlette ASGI objects like Request , Response , Session and so on are defined as components and ready to be injected in your endpoints. Components as the base of the plugin ecosystem, allowing you to create custom or use those already defined in your endpoints, injected as parameters. Auto generated API schema using OpenAPI standard. It uses the schema system of your endpoints to extract all the necessary information to generate your API Schema. Auto generated docs providing a Swagger UI or ReDoc endpoint. Pagination automatically handled using multiple methods such as limit and offset, page numbers... Requirements \u00b6 Python 3.6+ Starlette 0.10+ Installation \u00b6 $ pip install starlette-api Example \u00b6 from marshmallow import Schema, fields, validate from starlette_api.applications import Starlette # Data Schema class Puppy(Schema): id = fields.Integer() name = fields.String() age = fields.Integer(validate=validate.Range(min=0)) # Database puppies = [ {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Canna\", \"age\": 6}, {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Sandy\", \"age\": 12}, ] # Application app = Starlette( components=[], # Without custom components title=\"Foo\", # API title version=\"0.1\", # API version description=\"Bar\", # API description schema=\"/schema/\", # Path to expose OpenAPI schema docs=\"/docs/\", # Path to expose Swagger UI docs redoc=\"/redoc/\", # Path to expose ReDoc docs ) # Views @app.route(\"/\", methods=[\"GET\"]) def list_puppies(name: str = None) -> Puppy(many=True): \"\"\" List the puppies collection. There is an optional query parameter that specifies a name for filtering the collection based on it. Request example: GET http://example.com/?name=Sandy Response example: 200 [ {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Sandy\", \"age\": 12} ] \"\"\" return [puppy for puppy in puppies if puppy[\"name\"] == name] @app.route(\"/\", methods=[\"POST\"]) def create_puppy(puppy: Puppy) -> Puppy: \"\"\" Create a new puppy using data validated from request body and add it to the collection. Request example: POST http://example.com/ { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Canna\", \"age\": 6 } Response example: 200 { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Canna\", \"age\": 6 } \"\"\" puppies.append(puppy) return puppy Credits \u00b6 That library started as an adaptation APIStar to work with Starlette , but a great amount of the code has been rewritten to use Marshmallow as the schema system, to support websockets and adding new functionalities like pagination, generic resources...
